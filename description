Section Manager by Teqno

This will simplify the add/remove of sections for people
that finds it too tedious to manually do the work. It checks
for various scripts in /glftpd/bin folder including the script
pzs-ng and adds the proper lines. Be sure to put the right
paths for glftpd and pzs-ng before running this script and
don't forget to rehash the bot after the script is done. This
manager is intended for incoming sections only and not archive
